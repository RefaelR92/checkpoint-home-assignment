# checkpoint-home-assignment

Im using terraform vpc module and use single NAT gateway for 2 subnets just
because cost optimization. In production environment its better to have one NAT gateway for each subnet for HA.

i've connected my aws account to github actions by set oidc identity provider and created role with proper trust relationship (IaC with terraform)
